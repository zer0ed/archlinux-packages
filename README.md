# archlinux-packages
These are my older, outdated and unmaintained PKGBUILD packages for Arch Linux.
They have been uploaded here for archival purposes, please use the official channels
and methods for installing any Arch Linux packages as they will be correctly supported
and up to date.

The commit dates will reflect when they were pushed to github, not when I originally
created them as I wasn't using any version control system at the time.

I have done a commit for each version change I have available for completion sake.
